# ZERO WARRANTY

This may brick your RetroPie install!  I've extensively tested it on my own system, but that doesn't mean things will always work the way I experienced in the past!

# RetroTink-Setup

I *love* my RetroPie, and I really want to use my RetroTink with it... but I don't like the custom RetroTink's interface, I need something family-friendly... not exclusively engineer-friendly. üòÅ I'm sure my use of an emoji in my README.md disqualifies me as an engineer now!

This project is designed to make running RetroPie with a RetroTink as seamless as possible.  There are other projects that deal with it, but I found myself rewriting them to fix really obnoxious issues... so here we are!

# Goals

* Run on a vanilla RetroPie installation

* Make it expandable
  * Focus on using configuration files, not hard coded values
  * NTSC & PAL TVs don't behave the same, we should take that into consideration

* Make it maintainable
  * This is why I used Ansible to do most of the heavy lifting
  * Ansible also acts as easy-to-read documentation, for the engineers

# Requirements

* Raspberry Pi with a full size GPIO
* A RetroTink-Ultimate!
  * http://www.retrotink.com

# Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/xovox/RetroTink-Setup
cd RetroTink-Setup
sudo ./retrotink_setup.sh
```

* On Start Script
- [x] Use per-emulator timings
- [ ] Use per-game timings

* On End Script
- [x] Revert to boot's hdmi_timings

* Script Installer
- [x] Write installer wrapper
